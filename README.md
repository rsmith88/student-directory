# Student Directory #

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students at Makers Academy. 

There are two versions of the student directory. The first ("Directory_Original") includes a series of edits as set out in the course materials. The second ("Directory_Interactive") includes an interactive menu.

Directory_Q11 reflects the code requirements set out in exercise 11.
