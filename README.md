# Student Directory #

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students at Makers Academy. 

There are three versions of the student directory. The first ("Directory_Original") includes the changes required by the first set of exercises. The second ("Directory_Interactive") includes an interactive menu and the changes required by the second set of exercises. Directory_Q11 reflects the code specifications set out in exercise 11 (first set of exercises). 

Quine.rb is a program that prints its own source code.

## How to use ##

ruby directory.rb
